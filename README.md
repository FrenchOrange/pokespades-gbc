# Pokémon Ace and Spades

A rom hack based on [the Pokémon Crystal disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal). This is a GBC devamp of Farore's WIP GBA rom hack "Pokémon Ace and Spades".

(Do note that this rom hack is not compatible with base GSC.)*

## Version
The current version is the demo proper, going up to the first badge. A list of known bugs listed [here](KNOWN_ISSUES.txt).
