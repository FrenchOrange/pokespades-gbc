BUGS:
* HIGH
** Player House 1F Running Shoes walk back softlocks if triggered a third time. Happens on both sides of the carpet.
** Lotus Town Roadblock Guy softlocks when stepping on the leftmost event trigger first. Trying it after another works just fine.
** Road A00 starter event softlocks if third and fourth event triggers are stepped on. The other two work fine.


* MILD
** Bedroom carpets need to be adjusted. (Decorations can't be obtained in the demo).
** Twins April and May have a text overflow issue with their "spaced-out" name. (Can leave out the spaces for now).
